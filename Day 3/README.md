# Day 3 - Combinational and sequential optmizations

## Introduction to optimizations

Logic Optimization helps mainly to optimise the circuit which will help to save power and area. In this workshop mainly focused on the combinational and sequential logic optimizations <br />
<br />
Combinational Logic Optimization <br />
 - Constant Propogation (Direct optimisation)

 - Boolean Logic Optimisation 
      - K-Map
      - Quine McKluskey

Sequential Logic Optimization <br />
- Basic
     - Sequential Constant Propogation

- Advanced 
     - State Optimisation (Opimisation of unused states)
     - Retiming (helps in improving the performance of the circuit)
     - Sequential Logic Cloning (Floor Plan Aware Synthesis)
